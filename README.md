# xilik

Yet another web framework? Not sure yet.

I've decided to try and build this pragmatic reactive thing as an experiment.

Objectives:
- Be as fast as possible in Javascript;
- Usage code should be as short as possible;
- xilik.js should be as short as possible without compromising readability;
- No build steps, webpack, etc. Run "directly" in the browser;
- Test directly in the browser.

This software isn't for production use! It's incomplete, full of bugs, and uses rather unsafe programming practices and aggressive conventions.

TODO:
- for loops
- radio buttons
- checkboxes
